## Installation / Deployment

Kindly follow below steps to deploy the contents of this repository in your Developer Edition Org or a Sandbox.

Prefer not to deploy this in a Trailhead Playground, as the Apex Class POV_Controller will need to be updated for the LWC-VF bidirectional code to work properly in a Trailhead Playground. Method getVFOrigin() in POV_Controller class has an elaborate Comment in there.


1. Clone this repository in your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sfwiseguys/LWCComms
    cd LWCComms
    ```

2. Authorize your org and provide it with an alias (example **mydevorg** in the command below):

    ```
    sfdx force:auth:web:login -s -a mydevorg
    ```

3. Run this command in a terminal to deploy this app in your Org

    ```
    sfdx force:source:deploy -p force-app
    ```

4. If your org isn't already open, open it now using this command:

    ```
    sfdx force:org:open -u mydevorg
    ```

Post Installation / Deployment, navigate to App Launcher, select the **LWC Comms** app to view the Three Tabs - 

* LMS POV - to see Lightning Message Service scenarios
* EMP API POV - to see LWCs listening to a Platform Event Channel
* POV LWC to VF in iFrame - LWC containing VF in an iframe, communicating to each other
